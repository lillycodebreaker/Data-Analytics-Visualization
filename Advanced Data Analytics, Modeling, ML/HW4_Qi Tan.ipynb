Through this assignment, you will engage with the process of topic modeling, including the training of multiple LDA models, evaluating of their performance and inspecting of the topics generated.\n","## Tasks\n","This homework includes the following 7 questions:\n","* **Q1**: Model Training. You will train two LDA models, one with 5 topics and another with 10 topics. (10 points)\n","* **Q2**: Model Evaluation. You will calculate the perplexity of each model and do the model selection. (15 points).\n","* **Q3**: Model Inspection. You will find the topic words of each model and compare these two models. (10 points)\n","* **Q4**: Model Test with Classic Books. You will test the model with several books and interpret the results (20 points)\n","* **Q5**: Conceptual Questions on Topic Modeling (20 points)\n","* **Q6**: Parsing with spaCy (15 points)\n","* **Q7**: Named Entity Recognition (NER) (10 points)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qU9UGso2ucRW"},"source":["## Environment Setup"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"nqOsrZltvklX","outputId":"69d26d19-74b7-4bb2-f176-2afdaecc7e9e","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1721962336778,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":9193,"user":{"displayName":"Qi Tan","userId":"00069661742172985235"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package averaged_perceptron_tagger to\n","[nltk_data]     /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping taggers/averaged_perceptron_tagger.zip.\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package wordnet to /root/nltk_data...\n"]}],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import csv\n","import yaml\n","\n","from gensim.models import LdaModel\n","from gensim.corpora import Dictionary\n","from gensim import corpora\n","import gensim.parsing.preprocessing as preprocessing\n","from gensim.utils import simple_preprocess\n","\n","import nltk\n","nltk.download([\"averaged_perceptron_tagger\", \"wordnet\"])\n","\n","from pprint import pprint\n","from tqdm.auto import tqdm\n","tqdm.pandas()\n","\n","# plotting\n","%matplotlib inline\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import matplotlib.colors as mcolors\n","from wordcloud import WordCloud"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"axopt30Duiz_"},"source":["## Data Setup\n","We use the CMU Book Summary Dataset for this homework.

Ken was self-supporting, working as a lifeguard at a Maine island resort, while Sylvia's family stayed as guests of the owners, one summer between years at college. After their summer love affair, they married other people, but rediscover each other later in life. At that time, Sylvia has a son, Johnny, and Ken a daughter, Molly. While Ken and Sylvia renew their love affair, their children begin a romance. Ken becomes a millionaire through his work as a research chemist as his wife Helen spurns him at home, while Sylvia's husband Bart turns to alcohol as his family fortune disappears, and he turns their island home into an inn. After twenty years away, Ken decides to visit the island again, writing Bart to ask for lodging. Ken brings Molly and Helen to the island, and everyone tries to be cordial. But soon old feelings, and tensions, and longings arise in the adults, while the young Johnny and Molly in turn become enamored of each other. Ken and Sylvia fall in love once again. The couple are noticed by Todd Hasper, the steward of the island, who decides to inform Sylvia's husband Bart. Ken, aware of Sylvia's plight, invites her and her family to take over a motel job in Florida for Bart has asked for a divorce and the custody of their son John. The affair between Ken and Sylvia is again noticed, this time by a friend of Helen's. The two divorce, and their daughter Molly, like John, is sent to boarding school. During their tenure at their respective schools, John and Molly begin an avid correspondence. Helen and her mother Margaret are not pleased, as they find it inappropriate for a girl her age to be so attached to a boy. Their correspondence continues, with rendezvous during school breaks. Their romance culminates when they see each other again at Ken and Sylvia's beach house. The two acknowledge that they are in love with one another, and they consummate it shortly thereafter. Back at school, Molly learns from a doctor that she is pregnant, and John hitchhikes across the country to be with and support her. Ken and Sylvia give their guarded approval, feeling hypocritical to deny them their love. Bart, whose alcoholism has landed him in a veterans hospital, cannot attend the wedding, and while he disapproves, he urges John to take over the inn. Helen attends the wedding under sedation. The book ends with John and Molly spending their honeymoon on Pine Island, John's \\\"one good inheritance\\\", as Bart terms it in a letter.\",\n          \" The story begins on Pluto in the distant future. Its inhabitants, former collaborators of the Qax, humanity's erstwhile conquerors, are under attack from the new-formed Coalition, seeking revenge for humanity's enslavement. As such, the inhabitants send five generation ships out of the solar system in the hopes that they will be able to form colonies of their own that can survive the Coalition. Rusel, the protagonist, is admitted onto Mayflower II, one of the ships, at the last minute. Shortly after takeoff, it is revealed that the ship's intended destination is outside the galaxy, requiring a flight time of 50,000 subjective years, even with the effects of time dilation. The ship's captain selects a few individuals to receive medical treatment granting them immortality, allowing them to guide the ship through its millennia-long voyage. Over time, however, these individuals die through malfunctions or boredom, leaving Rusel as the only immortal on board, but he becomes increasingly dependent on life-support and gradually merges with the ship. Over time, the other inhabitants of the ship form several different societies, gradually becoming detached from their original humanity. Eventually, they form an almost unrecongisable tribal civilisation. Having forgotten that they are on a spaceship at all, they only maintain it through religious tradition. After 25,000 years have passed, the Mayflower is contacted by Pirius and Torec (protagonists of Exultant), former soldiers of the Coalition, which is revealed to have fallen. They offer to remove the inhabitants from the ship and care for them elsewhere. Rusel, now completely merged with the ship's systems, allows them to do so. Pirius and Torec then leave Rusel to continue into space without the burden of the crew, which he gladly accepts.\",\n          \" Like the sixth collection, Fables and Reflections, and the eighth, Worlds' End, Dream Country consists of short stories that do not have a common storyline running through them, though it has been argued that most Sandman stories are not entirely self-contained and are part of a larger story arc that encompasses the entire series. Dream Country is the shortest of the eleven Sandman collections, featuring just four issues (\\\"Calliope\\\", #17, and \\\"A Dream of a Thousand Cats\\\", #18, both pencilled by Kelley Jones and inked by Malcolm Jones III; \\\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\\", #19, drawn by Charles Vess and coloured for the first time by computer colouring pioneer Steve Oliff; and \\\"Fa\\u00e7ade\\\", #20, penciled by Colleen Doran and inked by Malcolm Jones III). This is the story of a frustrated author, Richard Madoc, whose first book has been released to critical acclaim but who simply cannot write a page of the promised follow-up. He strikes a deal with an elder writer, Erasmus Fry, for Calliope, one of the Muses of Greek mythology, whom Fry had captured earlier in his life, in exchange for a bezoar. Fry kept her imprisoned and regularly raped her, and her presence provided the inspiration for his successful novels. Madoc also takes her captive and has great success in writing, but Calliope calls upon the triad of witches known by many names, such as the Furies, the Kindly Ones or the Gracious Ladies, for help. They direct her to Morpheus, who we are told was once her lover (this relationship is elaborated on later in the series), and who is currently similarly imprisoned. Upon his release, he comes to rescue Calliope, and visits a terrible punishment upon Madoc. He complains that without her, he will have no ideas, so Morpheus causes him to never stop having them, which drives him to madness. Though the story of \\\"Calliope\\\" was not criticized for unoriginality at the time of its release, its concept has apparently become a very popular one since; a list of overused story ideas at Strange Horizons included \\\"Creative person meets a muse (either one of the nine classical Muses or a more individual muse) and interacts with them, usually by keeping them captive.\\\" (See Neil Gaiman's post about Strange Horizon's list). Madoc's Book \\\"Her Wings\\\" appears in a few other stories by Neil Gaiman including The Last Temptation as a sort of inside joke. Rose Walker is later seen reading Fry's book \\\"Here Comes a Candle\\\". In the library of Dream, an unfinished book by Erasmus Fry, \\\"The Hand of Glory\\\" is seen in Season of Mists. One of Madoc's works, \\\"The Spirit Who Had Half Of Everything\\\", takes its name from an unused chapter title in an early draft of James Branch Cabell's Figures of Earth. This tale begins with a small, white cat being called by another cat to sneak away from her house one night. They speak of an event in a graveyard that they don't want to miss. When they arrive, they see that many cats are already there. A Siamese cat comes to tell her story. A long time ago, the Siamese cat relates, she met a Tom-cat, who became her lover. Eventually, she gave birth to several kittens. Her human owners were not pleased, and the male owner put the kittens in a bag bound to a rock, and threw them into pond. Traumatized by the callous murder of her kittens, the Siamese becomes disillusioned in human beings and ultimately rejects the life of a pampered pet. Her cause is strengthened when she has a dream that she has entered a boneyard in the Dreaming. In the dream a raven with no skin on its head informs her where she can find out exactly why the humans killed her offspring: a cave inhabited by the Dream Lord. At the entrance to the cave that the raven told her of, many fearsome animals tell her to leave. She responds by saying that she will only state her business to Dream. Inside, she finds Dream in the form of a cat. Dream presents her with a vision of an alternate reality where cats are huge and humans are merely their playthings, tiny servants which groom their bodies and which the cats can kill at their leisure. A man ruined that world by informing the humans that their dreams will shape the world. Enough humans listened to make the vision a reality. Upon waking, the cat undertakes a spiritual quest for justice. She preaches her vision to motley assortments of housecats around the world, hoping that if she can make enough believe in and dream of this reality, the world will change to conform to their dreams. The cat from the beginning of the story heads home. Her friends were slightly disappointed, though they admitted that what they heard was interesting. The white cat, however, was fully taken by the tale. She returns home and heads to sleep. Over breakfast, her owners remark on what a cute stance she's in: it looks as if she's hunting something, or someone. Although seemingly a complete diversion from the basic story of the Sandman, it in fact illustrates some of the core themes of the series: the idea that reality is shaped in the most literal sense by the dreams, beliefs, and expectations of humans (and, in this case, of other animals as well). The story also portrays the theme of change and its relation to an individual's nature. The humans found that they were unhappy with their role and were able to harness the power of dream to instigate a change of the nature of reality, whereas when cats found themselves in a similar situation their apathetic, independent, and fickle nature kept them from changing. This idea of the capacity for change reemerges throughout the book, most notably in the conclusion of The Kindly Ones. !-- This section is linked from Characters of The Sandman --> This is a core issue of the Sandman series, sometimes cited as the best in the series. It concerns the premiere of William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, which we are told was commissioned by Morpheus as part of a bargain in which Morpheus granted Shakespeare his extraordinary skill with writing. Performed on a hillside before an audience of bizarre creatures from Faerie - including the very characters who appear in the play, Titania, Auberon, and the hobgoblin Robin Goodfellow (Puck) amongst them - the Sandman's version of reality and Shakespeare's play are merged and interact with one another. Puck greatly enjoys the play and repeats the theme of the story that while the play does not directly reflect history or even some of the personalities of the characters it is still considered a true reflection of \\\"reality\\\". (In reality Puck is described as being a psychotic murderer and not a merry wanderer of the night.) Titania takes an interest in Shakespeare's son Hamnet, who plays a small role in the play. The issue received a World Fantasy Award for short fiction in 1991. Dream first meets Shakespeare in Sandman #13, &#34;Men of Good Fortune,&#34; and the final issue, #75, &#34;The Tempest,&#34; focuses on the second of the two plays commissioned by Morpheus. This is another odd issue, featuring one of the methods Gaiman played with in the first, and to a lesser extent in the second, collection: it takes one of the neglected characters from the DC Universe, this time Element Girl (Urania Blackwell, a female version of Metamorpho), and shows her in a completely unexpected situation. A reluctant superhero at best, she has now retired, and lives a meagre existence, rarely leaving her flat due to her self-loathing of her &#34;freakish&#34; appearance. She goes by her nickname &#34;Rainie&#34;. The plot revolves around a phone call she receives: an invitation to have dinner with an old friend, Della. She concocts a fake face to wear so her friend doesn&#39;t know of her &#34;skin disease&#34;. As Della explains a problem she&#39;s having, Rainie&#39;s &#34;face&#34; falls into the plate of spaghetti bolognese that she ordered, revealing her true face. She runs away, and to her apartment, where she wonders how she can kill herself, despite being invulnerable. Fortunately, Death, who was dealing with a woman who&#39;d slipped on a stepladder, enters her room, explaining that the door was open, and she had heard her crying. She tells her how she can talk to the sun god, Ra, and beg for a merciful death. An extraordinarily poignant piece dealing with identity and, subtly, the gap between the world portrayed in the more na\\u00efve of DC Comics&#39; superhero comics and the true reality of everyday life, it ends on a curiously happy note, with Death answering Rainie&#39;s telephone and informing the caller that &#34;she&#39;s gone away, I&#39;m afraid.&#34;\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary_name_removed\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16532,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"  The book focuses on the adult lives of two onetime teenage lovers , and , who were from different social strata . was self - supporting , working as a lifeguard at a Maine island resort , while 's family stayed as guests of the owners , one summer between years at college .

As such , the inhabitants send five generation ships out of the solar system in the hopes that they will be able to form colonies of their own that can survive the Coalition . Rusel , the protagonist , is admitted onto , one of the ships , at the last minute . Shortly after takeoff , it is revealed that the ship 's intended destination is outside the galaxy , requiring a flight time of 50,000 subjective years , even with the effects of time dilation . The ship 's captain selects a few individuals to receive medical treatment granting them immortality , allowing them to guide the ship through its millennia - long voyage . Over time , however , these individuals die through malfunctions or boredom , leaving Rusel as the only immortal on board , but he becomes increasingly dependent on life - support and gradually merges with the ship . Over time , the other inhabitants of the ship form several different societies , gradually becoming detached from their original humanity .

This is the story of a frustrated author , , whose first book has been released to critical acclaim but who simply can not write a page of the promised follow - up . He strikes a deal with an elder writer , , for , one of the Muses of Greek mythology , whom had captured earlier in his life , in exchange for a bezoar . kept her imprisoned and regularly raped her , and her presence provided the inspiration for his successful novels . also takes her captive and has great success in writing , but calls upon the triad of witches known by many names , such as the Furies , , for help . They direct her to , who we are told was once her lover ( this relationship is elaborated on later in the series ) , and who is currently similarly imprisoned . Upon his release , he comes to rescue , and visits a terrible punishment upon . He complains that without her , he will have no ideas , so causes him to never stop having them , which drives him to madness . Though the story of \\\" Calliope \\\" was not criticized for unoriginality at the time of its release , its concept has apparently become a very popular one since ; a list of overused story ideas at included \\\" Creative person meets a muse ( either one of the nine classical Muses or a more individual muse ) and interacts with them , usually by keeping them captive . \\\" ( See 's post about list ) . 's Book \\\" Her Wings \\\" appears in a few other stories by including The Last Temptation as a sort of inside joke . is later seen reading book \\\" Here Comes a Candle \\\" . In the library of , an unfinished book by , \\\" The Hand of Glory \\\" is seen in Season of Mists . One of 's works , \\\" The Spirit Who Had Half Of Everything \\\" , takes its name from an unused chapter title in an early draft of Figures of Earth . This tale begins with a small , white cat being called by another cat to sneak away from her house one night . They speak of an event in a graveyard that they do n't want to miss . When they arrive , they see that many cats are already there . A Siamese cat comes to tell her story . A long time ago , the Siamese cat relates , she met a - cat , who became her lover . Eventually , she gave birth to several kittens . Her human owners were not pleased , and the male owner put the kittens in a bag bound to a rock , and threw them into pond . Traumatized by the callous murder of her kittens , the Siamese becomes disillusioned in human beings and ultimately rejects the life of a pampered pet . Her cause is strengthened when she has a dream that she has entered a boneyard in the Dreaming . In the dream a raven with no skin on its head informs her where she can find out exactly why the humans killed her offspring : a cave inhabited by the Dream Lord . At the entrance to the cave that the raven told her of , many fearsome animals tell her to leave . She responds by saying that she will only state her business to Dream . Inside , she finds Dream in the form of a cat . Dream presents her with a vision of an alternate reality where cats are huge and humans are merely their playthings , tiny servants which groom their bodies and which the cats can kill at their leisure . A man ruined that world by informing the humans that their dreams will shape the world . Enough humans listened to make the vision a reality . Upon waking , the cat undertakes a spiritual quest for justice . She preaches her vision to motley assortments of housecats around the world , hoping that if she can make enough believe in and dream of this reality , the world will change to conform to their dreams . The cat from the beginning of the story heads home . Her friends were slightly disappointed , though they admitted that what they heard was interesting . The white cat , however , was fully taken by the tale . She returns home and heads to sleep . Over breakfast , her owners remark on what a cute stance she 's in : it looks as if she 's hunting something , or someone . Although seemingly a complete diversion from the basic story of the , it in fact illustrates some of the core themes of the series : the idea that reality is shaped in the most literal sense by the dreams , beliefs , and expectations of humans ( and , in this case , of other animals as well ) . The story also portrays the theme of change and its relation to an individual 's nature . The humans found that they were unhappy with their role and were able to harness the power of dream to instigate a change of the nature of reality , whereas when cats found themselves in a similar situation their apathetic , independent , and fickle nature kept them from changing . This idea of the capacity for change reemerges throughout the book , most notably in the conclusion of . ! -- This section is linked from Characters of The Sandman -- > This is a core issue of the series , sometimes cited as the best in the series . It concerns the premiere of A Midsummer Night 's Dream , which we are told was commissioned by as part of a bargain in which granted his extraordinary skill with writing . Performed on a hillside before an audience of bizarre creatures from Faerie - including the very characters who appear in the play , , , and the hobgoblin ( ) amongst them - the 's version of reality and 's play are merged and interact with one another . greatly enjoys the play and repeats the theme of the story that while the play does not directly reflect history or even some of the personalities of the characters it is still considered a true reflection of \\\" reality \\\" . ( In reality is described as being a psychotic murderer and not a merry wanderer of the night . ) takes an interest in 's son , who plays a small role in the play . The issue received a World Fantasy Award for short fiction in 1991 . Dream first meets in # 13 , & # 34;Men of Good Fortune,&#34 ; and the final issue , # 75 , & # 34;The Tempest,&#34 ; focuses on the second of the two plays commissioned by . This is another odd issue , featuring one of the methods played with in the first , and to a lesser extent in the second , collection : it takes one of the neglected characters from , this time Element Girl ( , a female version of Metamorpho ) , and shows her in a completely unexpected situation . A reluctant superhero at best , she has now retired , and lives a meagre existence , rarely leaving her flat due to her self - loathing of her & # 34;freakish&#34 ; appearance . She goes by her nickname & # 34;Rainie&#34 ; . The plot revolves around a phone call she receives : an invitation to have dinner with an old friend , . She concocts a fake face to wear so her friend doesn&#39;t know of her & # 34;skin disease&#34 ; . As explains a problem she&#39;s having , Rainie&#39;s & # 34;face&#34 ; falls into the plate of spaghetti bolognese that she ordered , revealing her true face . She runs away , and to her apartment , where she wonders how she can kill herself , despite being invulnerable . Fortunately , Death , who was dealing with a woman who&#39;d slipped on a stepladder , enters her room , explaining that the door was open , and she had heard her crying . She tells her how she can talk to the sun god , , and beg for a merciful death . An extraordinarily poignant piece dealing with identity and , subtly , the gap between the world portrayed in the more na\\u00efve of ; superhero comics and the true reality of everyday life , it ends on a curiously happy note , with Death answering Rainie&#39;s telephone and informing the caller that & # 34;she&#39;s gone away , I&#39;m ;\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":3}],"source":["book_df.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FDvA_50YvVAc"},"source":["### Data Preprocessing\n","We preprocess the text in `summary_name_removed` with the following steps:\n","\n","* Lower the letters.\n","* Remove punctuations, digits, multiple_whitespaces, and stopwords.\n","* Lemmatize the tokens.\n","\n","Each processed summary will be converted into a list of tokens and stored in the column `processed_summary`.\n","\n","You can run the codes for preprocessing without any edits needed.

Characterized as a sociopath and a hardened juvenile delinquent, Alex is also intelligent and quick-witted, with sophisticated taste in music, being particularly fond of Beethoven, or \\\"Lovely Ludwig Van.\\\" The novel begins with the droogs sitting in their favorite hangout (the Korova Milkbar), drinking milk-drug cocktails, called \\\"milk-plus\\\", to hype themselves for the night's mayhem. They assault a scholar walking home from the public library, rob a store leaving the owner and his wife bloodied and unconscious, stomp a panhandling derelict, then scuffle with a rival gang. Joyriding through the countryside in a stolen car, they break into an isolated cottage and maul the young couple living there, beating the husband and raping his wife. In a metafictional touch, the husband is a writer working on a manuscript called \\\"A Clockwork Orange,\\\" and Alex contemptuously reads out a paragraph that states the novel's main theme before shredding the manuscript. Back at the milk bar, Alex punishes Dim for some crude behaviour, and strains within the gang become apparent. At home in his dreary flat, Alex plays classical music at top volume while fantasizing of even more orgiastic violence. Alex skips school the next day. Following an unexpected visit from P.R. Deltoid, his \\\"post-corrective advisor,\\\" Alex meets a pair of ten-year-old girls and takes them back to his parents' flat, where he administers hard drugs and then rapes them. That evening, Alex finds his droogs in a mutinous mood. Georgie challenges Alex for leadership of the gang, demanding that they pull a \\\"man-sized\\\" job. Alex quells the rebellion by slashing Dim's hand and fighting with Georgie, then in a show of generosity takes them to a bar, where Alex insists on following through on Georgie's idea to burgle the home of a wealthy old woman. The break-in starts as farce and ends in tragic pathos, as Alex's attack kills the elderly woman. His escape is blocked by Dim, who attacks Alex, leaving him incapacitated on the front step as the police arrive. Sentenced to prison for murder, Alex gets a job at the Wing chapel playing religious music on the stereo before and after services as well as during the singing of hymns. The prison chaplain mistakes Alex's Bible studies for stirrings of faith (Alex is actually reading Scripture for the violent passages). After Alex's fellow cellmates blame him for beating a troublesome cellmate to death, he agrees to undergo an experimental behaviour-modification treatment called the Ludovico Technique. The technique is a form of aversion therapy in which Alex receives an injection that makes him feel sick while watching graphically violent films, eventually conditioning him to suffer crippling bouts of nausea at the mere thought of violence. As an unintended consequence, the soundtrack to one of the films\\u2014Beethoven's Fifth Symphony\\u2014renders Alex unable to listen to his beloved classical music. The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated to a group of VIPs, who watch as Alex collapses before a walloping bully, and abases himself before a scantily-clad young woman whose presence has aroused his predatory sexual inclinations. Though the prison chaplain accuses the state of stripping Alex of free will, the government officials on the scene are pleased with the results and Alex is released into society. Since his parents are now renting his room to a lodger, Alex wanders the streets and enters a public library where he hopes to learn a painless way to commit suicide. There, he accidentally encounters the old scholar he assaulted earlier in the book, who, keen on revenge, beats Alex with the help of his friends. The policemen who come to Alex's rescue turn out to be none other than Dim and former gang rival Billyboy. The two policemen take Alex outside of town and beat him up. Dazed and bloodied, Alex collapses at the door of an isolated cottage, realizing too late that it is the house he and his droogs invaded in the first half of the story. Because the gang wore masks during the assault, the writer does not recognize Alex. The writer, whose name is revealed as F. Alexander, shelters Alex and questions him about the conditioning. During this sequence, it is revealed that Mrs. Alexander died from the injuries inflicted during the gang-rape, and her husband has decided to continue living \\\"where her fragrant memory persists\\\" despite the horrid memories. Alexander, a critic of the government, hopes to use Alex as a symbol of state brutality and thereby prevent the incumbent government from being re-elected. Eventually, he begins to realize Alex's role in the happenings of the night two years ago. One of Alexander's radical associates manages to extract a confession from Alex after removing him from F. Alexander's home and then locks him in a flatblock near his former home. Alex is then subjected to a relentless barrage of classical music, prompting him to attempt suicide by leaping from a high window. Alex wakes up in hospital, where he is courted by government officials anxious to counter the bad publicity created by his suicide attempt. With Alexander safely packed off to a mental institution, Alex is offered a well-paying job if he agrees to side with the government. As photographers snap pictures, Alex daydreams of orgiastic violence and realizes the Ludovico conditioning has been reversed: \\\"I was cured all right.\\\" In the final chapter, Alex has a new trio of droogs, but he finds he is beginning to outgrow his taste for violence. A chance encounter with Pete, now married and settled down, inspires Alex to seek a wife and family of his own. He contemplates the likelihood of his future son being a delinquent as he was, a prospect Alex views fatalistically.\",\n          \" The novel posits that space around the Milky Way is divided into concentric layers called Zones, each being constrained by different laws of physics and each allowing for different degrees of biological and technological advancement. The innermost, the \\\"Unthinking Depths\\\", surrounds the galactic core and is incapable of supporting advanced life forms at all. The next layer, the \\\"Slow Zone\\\", is roughly equivalent to the real world in behavior and potential. Further out, the zone named the \\\"Beyond\\\" can support futuristic technologies such as AI and FTL travel. The outermost zone, the \\\"Transcend\\\", contains most of the galactic halo and is populated by incomprehensibly vast and powerful posthuman entities. A human expedition investigates a five-billion-year-old data archive that offers the possibility of unimaginable riches for the ambitious young civilization of the Straumli Realm. The expedition's facility, called High Lab, is gradually compromised by a dormant super-intelligent entity (actually encoded within the archive) later known as the Blight. The Blight rapidly learns how to infiltrate and control the computer systems of High Lab, and even develops the ability to possess and control the living humans. The novel starts with an imaginative description of the evolution of this superintelligence through exponentially accelerating developmental stages, culminating in a transcendent, nigh-omnipotent power that is unfathomable to mere humans. Shortly before its final \\\"flowering\\\", the changes in a single minute of the Blight's life are said to exceed those of 10,000 years of human civilization. Recognizing the danger of what they have awakened, the researchers at High Lab attempt to flee in two ships. Suspicious, the Blight discovers that one of the ships contains a data storage device in its cargo manifest; assuming it contains information that could harm it, the Blight destroys the ship. The second ship is allowed to escape, unharmed, as the Blight assumes that it is no threat; but later realizes that it actually held a countermeasure, one of the few things in the universe that the Blight fears. The ship lands on a distant planet with a medieval-level civilization of dog-like creatures dubbed \\\"Tines\\\", who live in packs as group minds. The ship is revealed to be a sleeper ship, carrying most of High Lab's children in \\\"coldsleep boxes\\\". The boxes are rapidly failing and the surviving adults begin unloading them, but are killed when one of two rival forces of Tines seize the ship. The faction that initially contacts the humans, led by a Tine known as Steel, kills the adults and destroys many of the coldsleep boxes. They also capture a boy named Jefri Olsndot, whom Steel intended on killing but eventually exploits in order to develop advanced technology (such as cannon and radio communication). Jefri's older sister, Johanna, is rescued by Pilgrim and Scriber, wandering Tines who bring her to the rival faction, led by Woodcarver. She is asked to help develop technology that could gain the upper hand in the impending war. A distress signal from the sleeper ship eventually reaches \\\"Relay\\\", a major node in the galactic communications network. A benign transcendent entity (known as a \\\"Power\\\") named \\\"Old One\\\" contacts Relay, seeking information about the Blight and the humans who released it. Old One constructs a seemingly human man, Pham Nuwen, to act as its agent. Pham and Ravna Bergsndot \\u2013 a human employee of Relay's owners, the wealthy Vrinimi Organization \\u2013 trace the sleeper ship's signal to the Tines world. Old One designs a vessel, the Out of Band II, to reach the Tines world and to investigate what the ship carried with it from the High Lab. The Blight attacks Relay and Old One. Old One gives Pham the information necessary to activate the Blight Countermeasure while dying (a process known as godshatter), and Pham and Ravna escape Relay's destruction in the Out of Band II. After arriving at the Tines homeworld and allying with Woodcarver to defeat Steel, Pham initiates the Countermeasure, which extends the Slow Zone by thousands of light-years to enclose the Blight. This ends the threat of the Blight at the cost of wrecking thousands of uninvolved civilizations, causing trillions of deaths and potentially the extinction of several galactic races. The process also kills Pham and strands the other humans on the Tines world, now in the depths of the \\\"Slow Zone\\\" where rescue by an advanced civilization is impossible.\",\n          \" The text of The Plague is divided into five parts. In the town of Oran, thousands of rats, initially unnoticed by the populace, begin to die in the streets. A hysteria develops soon afterward, causing the local newspapers to report the incident. Authorities responding to public pressure order the collection and cremation of the rats, unaware that the collection itself was the catalyst for the spread of the bubonic plague. The main character, Dr. Bernard Rieux, lives comfortably in an apartment building when strangely the building's concierge, M. Michel, a confidante, dies from a fever. Dr. Rieux consults his colleague, Castel, about the illness until they come to the conclusion that a plague is sweeping the town. They both approach fellow doctors and town authorities about their theory, but are eventually dismissed on the basis of one death. However, as more and more deaths quickly ensue, it becomes apparent that there is an epidemic. Authorities, including the Prefect, M. Othon, are slow to accept that the situation is serious and quibble over the appropriate action to take. Official notices enacting control measures are posted, but the language used is optimistic and downplays the seriousness of the situation. A \\\"special ward\\\" is opened at the hospital, but its 80 beds are filled within three days. As the death toll begins to rise, more desperate measures are taken. Homes are quarantined; corpses and burials are strictly supervised. A supply of plague serum finally arrives, but there is only enough to treat existing cases and the country's emergency reserves are depleted. When the daily number of deaths jumps to 30, the town is sealed and an outbreak of plague is officially declared. The town is sealed off. The town gates are shut, rail travel is prohibited, and all mail service is suspended. The use of telephone lines is restricted only to \\\"urgent\\\" calls, leaving short telegrams as the only means of communicating with friends or family outside the town. The separation affects daily activity and depresses the spirit of the townspeople, who begin to feel isolated and introverted, and the plague begins to affect various characters. One character, Raymond Rambert, devises a plan to escape the city to join his lover in Paris after city officials refuse his request to leave. He befriends some criminals so that they may smuggle him out of the city. Another character, Father Paneloux, uses the plague as an opportunity to advance his stature in the town by suggesting that the plague was an act of God punishing the citizens' sinful nature. His diatribe falls on the ears of many citizens of the town, who turned to religion in droves but would not have done so under normal circumstances. Cottard, a criminal remorseful enough to attempt suicide yet fearful of being arrested, becomes wealthy as a major smuggler. Meanwhile, Dr. Rieux, a vacationer Jean Tarrou, and a civil servant Joseph Grand exhaustively treat patients in their homes and in the hospital. Rambert informs Tarrou of his escape plan, but when Tarrou tells him that others in the city, including Dr. Rieux, also have loved ones outside the city whom they are not allowed to see, Rambert becomes sympathetic and changes his mind. He then decides to join Tarrou and Dr. Rieux to help fight the epidemic. In mid-August, the situation continues to worsen. People try to escape the town, but some are shot by armed sentries. Violence and looting break out on a small scale, and the authorities respond by declaring martial law and imposing a curfew. Funerals are conducted with more and more speed, no ceremony, and little concern for the feelings of the families of the deceased. The inhabitants passively endure their increasing feelings of exile and separation; despondent, they waste away emotionally as well as physically. In September and October, the town remains at the mercy of the plague. Rieux hears from the sanatorium that his wife's condition is worsening. He also hardens his heart regarding the plague victims so that he can continue to do his work. Cottard, on the other hand, seems to flourish during the plague, because it gives him a sense of being connected to others, since everybody faces the same danger. Cottard and Tarrou attend a performance of Gluck's opera Orpheus and Eurydice, but the actor portraying Orpheus collapses with plague symptoms during the performance. Rambert finally has a chance to escape, but he decides to stay, saying that he would feel ashamed of himself if he left. Towards the end of October, Castel's new anti-plague serum is tried for the first time, but it cannot save the life of Othon's young son, who suffers greatly, as Paneloux, Rieux, and Tarrou look on in horror. Paneloux, who has joined the group of volunteers fighting the plague, gives a second sermon. He addresses the problem of an innocent child's suffering and says it is a test of a Christian's faith, since it requires him either to deny everything or believe everything. He urges the congregation not to give up the struggle but to do everything possible to fight the plague. A few days after the sermon, Paneloux is taken ill. His symptoms do not conform to those of the plague, but the disease still proves fatal. Tarrou and Rambert visit one of the isolation camps, where they meet Othon. When Othon's period of quarantine ends, he elects to stay in the camp as a volunteer because this will make him feel less separated from his dead son. Tarrou tells Rieux the story of his life, and the two men go swimming together in the sea. Grand catches the plague and instructs Rieux to burn all his papers. But Grand makes an unexpected recovery, and deaths from the plague start to decline. By late January, the plague is in full retreat, and the townspeople begin to celebrate the imminent opening of the town gates. Othon, however, does not escape death from the disease. Cottard is distressed by the ending of the epidemic, from which he has profited by shady dealings. Two government employees approach him, and he flees. Despite the epidemic's ending, Tarrou contracts the plague and dies after an heroic struggle. Rieux's wife also dies.

The next layer , \\\" , is roughly equivalent to the real world in behavior and potential . Further out , the zone named the \\\" Beyond \\\" can support futuristic technologies such as AI and FTL travel .

A human expedition investigates a five - billion - year - old data archive that offers the possibility of unimaginable riches for the ambitious young civilization of the Straumli Realm . The expedition 's facility , called , is gradually compromised by a dormant super - intelligent entity ( actually encoded within the archive ) later known as the Blight . The Blight rapidly learns how to infiltrate and control the computer systems of , and even develops the ability to possess and control the living humans .
